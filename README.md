I brought the prototype of my project that I'm working on in an app that creates images according to its algorithms. With Python, Tkinter and the OpenAI DALL-E2 API, I created an Image Generator application. with four different image styles: realistic, 3D Illustration, cartoon and flat art.
The app creates images based on what you write using artificial intelligence. I also added a slide bar where you can select the number of images you can use. .It was created to help people create perfect images for their projects.
Soon, I will have new updates more complete and with new features. For now just a project..
